# Causal Inference

In this post, we'll talk about the prerequistes and the vocabulary we need before diving into the causal way of the world.

## Statistical Foundations

The arithmetic mean is defined as:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

Where:

- $n$ is the number of observations
- $x_i$ is the $i$th observation

## Code Implementation

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_mean(data):
    return np.mean(data)

# Example usage
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = calculate_mean(data)
print(f"Mean: {mean}")  # Output: Mean: 3.0
```

## Jupyter Notebook Integration

You can also run this in a Jupyter notebook:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate random data
data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)

# Create histogram
plt.hist(data, bins=30)
plt.title("Normal Distribution")
plt.show()
```
